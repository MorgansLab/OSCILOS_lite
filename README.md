# OSCILOS_lite
OSCILOS_lite is an acoustic network model tool that can be used to predict the longitudinal acoustic modes appearing in reactive and non-reactive geometries. It can thus be used to predict the thermoacoustic stability of combustors. OSCILOS_lite was developed at Imperial College London by Renaud Gaudron, Alexander MacLaren, and Aimee S. Morgans. The code is open source and written in MATLAB.
